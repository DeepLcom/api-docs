### Get started

You can find and manage your admin API keys in the [“Admin Keys” tab](https://www.deepl.com/your-account/admin) when 
signed into your DeepL API account. It’s possible to create multiple, simultaneously active admin API keys in a single 
API subscription.

### Basic admin API key management

**Create new key**

Create a new admin API key by clicking on the "Create Key" button. 
You can optionally give an API key a custom name during the creation process. 
If you do not name the key, the name “DeepL API Key” will be given to the key automatically.

You can create up to 25 simultaneously active API keys.

</Frame>

After creating a key, a popup with the newly created key will appear:

    ![](/_assets/images/admin-api-key-created.png)
</Frame>

You can copy the key from this popup and use the key immediately. 
You can also copy the key from the table in the “Admin Keys” tab at any time.

Note that the generated admin keys always have an *:adm* suffix, to distinguish them from the developer keys which do not have a suffix.

Giving your API keys a name during the key creation process makes it possible for you to search for the key by name
using the search bar on the “Admin Keys” tab:

#### Deactivate key

<Warning>
    **IMPORTANT:** An API key will stop working immediately when deactivated. After a key is deactivated, it cannot be reactivated—deactivating a key is permanent!
</Warning>

To deactivate an active admin API key:

</Frame>

</Frame>

#### Rename key

Allows you to edit the name of an API key. Note that it *is* possible for two keys to have the same name.

Both active and deactivated keys can be renamed.

For security reasons, we do not show the full key in the table in the “Admin Keys” tab. Both active and deactivated keys can be copied.
