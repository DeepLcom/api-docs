title: "New: XML/HTML handling v2"
description: "Information on the improved version 2 of tag-handling translations"
---

In 2025, we completely overhauled the tag-handling algorithm that backs translation of XML and HTML in the DeepL API.

The new **tag handling v2** represents a major step forward for customers who need best-in-class XML and HTML tag handling.
To enable it and benefit from all the improvements, set the 'tag_handling_version' parameter to 'v2'.
Our updates ensure the best possible translation quality across all use cases.

As a result of these major updates, tag handling is expected to give different results when v2 is used. 
Before switching to `v2`, ensure you've thoroughly tested your system and are aware of any differences in the output.


<Info>
  Please note that v2 will become the default on 1 December 2025.
  To ensure a seamless transition, existing customers will have the option to request v1 for an additional grace period.
  This allows to adaptions to existing integrations, for example if they are contingent on particular tag handling behaviours exhibited by v1.
</Info>


<Info>
  As of now, tag handling v2 is only compatible with the <a href="/api-reference/translate#param-model-type">quality-optimized model type</a>.
  When you set `tag_handling_version` to `v2`, the `model_type` is implicitly set to `quality_optimized`. 

  Setting both `model_type=latency_optimized` and `tag_handling_version=v2` in a request will lead to an error.
