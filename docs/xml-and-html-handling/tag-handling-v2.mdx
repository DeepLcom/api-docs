title: "New: XML/HTML handling v2"
description: "Information on the improved version 2 of tag-handling translations"
---

In 2025, we completely overhauled the tag-handling algorithm that backs translation of XML and HTML in the DeepL API.

The new **tag handling v2** represents a major step forward for customers who need best-in-class XML and HTML tag handling.
To enable it and benefit from all the improvements, set the 'tag_handling_version' parameter to 'v2'.
Our updates ensure the best possible translation quality across all use cases.

As a result of these major updates, tag handling is expected to give different results when v2 is used. 
Before switching to `v2`, thoroughly test your system and verify any differences in output.

Additionally, v2 enforces strict parsing of XML. If invalid XML is submitted, the API will return an error.

<Info>
  Please note that after 1 December 2025, new customers will default to v2 and no longer be able to use v1.
  Existing customers will continue to default to v1 for the time being, and can opt-in to using v2.
</Info>

<Info>
  As of now, tag handling v2 is only compatible with the <a href="/api-reference/translate#param-model-type">quality-optimized model type</a>.
  When you set `tag_handling_version` to `v2`, the `model_type` is implicitly set to `quality_optimized`. 

  Requests that specify both `model_type=latency_optimized` and `tag_handling_version=v2` will return an error.
