## Get an API key and get started

New user? Follow these quick steps to get started with the DeepL API.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up for the API" titleSize="h3">
    Visit [our plans page](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api#api-pricing), choose a plan, and sign up.

    <Tip>
      If you already have a DeepL Translator account, you will need to log out and [create a new account for the DeepL API](https://support.deepl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019358999-Change-plan).
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Test your API key with a request" titleSize="h3">
    Find your API key [here](https://www.deepl.com/en/your-account/keys).
     Then try making a simple translation request in one of these ways:
    * cURL or an HTTP request
    * with [our client libraries](/api-reference/client-libraries) for [Python](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-python), [JavaScript](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-node), [PHP](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-php), [.NET](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-dotnet), [Java](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-java), or [Ruby](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-rb)
    * [in our playground](https://developers.deepl.com/api-reference/translate/request-translation?playground=open)
    * [in Postman](/docs/getting-started/test-your-api-requests-with-postman)

    If you use the sample code below, be sure to replace `{YOUR_API_KEY}` with your own API key.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="HTTP Request">
        <Tip>
          If you chose a free API plan and you are writing cURL or HTTP requests, replace `https://api.deepl.com` with `https://api-free.deepl.com`.
        </Tip>
           
        ```http Sample request
        POST /v2/translate HTTP/2
        Host: api.deepl.com
        Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key [yourAuthKey] 
        User-Agent: YourApp/1.2.3

        Content-Type: application/json
        
        {"text":["Hello, world!"],"target_lang":"DE"}

            }
          ]
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="cURL">
        <Tip>
          If you chose a free API plan and you are writing cURL or HTTP requests, replace `https://api.deepl.com` with `https://api-free.deepl.com`.
        </Tip>

        export API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}

  <Step title="Step 3: Keep building with our client libraries and how-to guides" titleSize="h3">
    [Our official client libraries](/api-reference/client-libraries) let you use the API with six popular programming languages - [Python](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-python), [JavaScript](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-node), [PHP](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-php), [.NET](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-dotnet), [Java](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-java), or [Ruby](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-rb). The DeepL community has [contributed client libraries](https://github.com/DeepLcom/awesome-deepl?tab=readme-ov-file#community-libraries--sdks) for other languages, including [Dart](https://github.com/komape/deepl_dart), [Go](https://github.com/candy12t/go-deepl), and [Rust](https://github.com/Avimitin/deepl-rs).
