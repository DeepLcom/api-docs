## Get an API Key and Get Started

New user? Follow these quick steps to get started with the DeepL API.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up for the API" titleSize="h3">
    Visit [our plans page](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro#developer), choose a plan, and sign up.
    <Tip>if you already have a DeepL Translator account, you will need to log out and create a new one for the DeepL API.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Test your API key with a request" titleSize="h3">
    Here are some ways to make a basic translation request to the API using cURL or six popular programming languages. Choose your favorite, making sure to replace`{YOUR_API_KEY}`with your own API key. You can find your API key [here](https://www.deepl.com/en/your-account/keys).
    <Tip>If you chose a free API plan and you are using cURL or HTTP requests, replace `https://api.deepl.com` with `https://api-free.deepl.com`.</Tip>
