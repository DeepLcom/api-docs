## Get an API key and get started

New user? Follow these quick steps to get started with the DeepL API.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up for the API" titleSize="h3">
    Visit [our plans page](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api#api-pricing), choose a plan, and sign up.

    <Tip>
      If you already have a DeepL Translator account, you will need to log out and create a new account for the DeepL API.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Test your API key with a request" titleSize="h3">
    Find your API key [here](https://www.deepl.com/en/your-account/keys).
     Then try making a simple translation request in one of these ways:
    * cURL or an HTTP request
    * with [our client libraries](api-reference/client-libraries) for [Python](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-python), [JavaScript](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-node), [PHP](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-php), [.NET](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-dotnet), [Java](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-java), or [Ruby](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-rb)
    * [in our playground](https://developers.deepl.com/api-reference/translate/request-translation?playground=open)
    * [in Postman](/docs/getting-started/test-your-api-requests-with-postman)

    If you use the sample code below, be sure to replace `{YOUR_API_KEY}` with your own API key.

    <Tip>
      If you chose a free API plan and you are writing cURL or HTTP requests, replace `https://api.deepl.com` with `https://api-free.deepl.com`.

      <Tab title="Curl">
        Open a terminal.

        ```sh Set the API key
        export API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
        ```

        ```sh Sample request
        curl -X POST https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --header "Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key $API_KEY" \
          --data '{
            "text": ["Hello world!"], 
            "target_lang": "DE"
        }'
        ```

        ```json Sample response

          "translations": [
            {
              "detected_source_language": "EN",
              "text": "Hallo, Welt!"
            }
          ]
        }

        Choose a local directory to work in.

        ```sh Install client library
        pip install deepl
        ```

        ```py Sample Request File
        import deepl
        
        auth_key = "{YOUR_API_KEY}"
        translator = deepl.Translator(auth_key)
        
        result = translator.translate_text("Hello, world!", target_lang="DE")
        print(result.text)
        ```

        ```text Sample Response
        Hallo, Welt!
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="NodeJS">
        Choose a local directory to work in.

        ```sh Install client library
        npm install deepl-node
        ```

        ```sh Sample Request File
        import * as deepl from 'deepl-node';
        
        const authKey = "{YOUR_API_KEY}";
        const translator = new deepl.Translator(authKey);
        
        (async () => {
            const result = await translator.translateText('Hello, world!', null, 'de');
            console.log(result.text);
        })();
        ```

        ```text Sample Response
        Hallo, Welt!

  <Step title="Step 3: Keep building with our client libraries and how-to guides" titleSize="h3">
    [Our official client libraries](/api-reference/client-libraries) let you use the API with six popular programming languages - [Python](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-python), [JavaScript](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-node), [PHP](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-php), [.NET](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-dotnet), [Java](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-java), or [Ruby](https://www.github.com/deeplcom/deepl-rb). The DeepL community has [contributed client libraries](https://github.com/DeepLcom/awesome-deepl?tab=readme-ov-file#community-libraries--sdks) for other languages, including [Dart](https://github.com/komape/deepl_dart), [Go](https://github.com/candy12t/go-deepl), and [Rust](https://github.com/Avimitin/deepl-rs). You may also wish to check out [these examples and guides](/docs/learning-how-tos/examples-and-guides).
