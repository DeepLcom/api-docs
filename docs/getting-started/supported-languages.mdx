<Info>
  Some languages are currently only available for text translation via our next-generation models and do not yet support glossaries or tag handling. You'll find these languages below under the "Text Translation Only Languages" subheadings for both source and target language lists. 

  Please note that only fully-featured languages will be returned by calls to the `/languages` endpoint.
