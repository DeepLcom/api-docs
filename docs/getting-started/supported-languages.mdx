<Info>
  Please note that Hebrew, Latin American Spanish, Thai and Vietnamese have not been added to the `/languages` endpoint as they are only available in the text translation API using next-gen models. When these languages are available for all translation endpoints (including document translation) they will be added to the `/languages` endpoint and this note will be removed.
