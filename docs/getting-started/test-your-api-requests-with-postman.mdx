Whether you are just getting started with DeepL API, or you already have an integration running in a production environment, sometimes it's a great idea to have a safe test environment to try things out first.

For convenience, we've created a Postman collection that mirrors the DeepL API functionality and lets you test your API in a structured environment. For more information about Postman, [check out their overview](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/).

To get started, [sign up for a developer account at deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/pro-checkout/account?productId=1200\&yearly=false\&trial=false) and get your authentication key from [your account page](https://www.deepl.com/account).

Click the button below to fork the DeepL API collection into your own Postman workspace:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/27518486-e9e2969d-d589-4d3d-9df6-cc514cf3ee5e?action=collection%2Ffork\&source=rip_markdown\&collection-url=entityId%3D27518486-e9e2969d-d589-4d3d-9df6-cc514cf3ee5e%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D48a52b53-0654-484b-861d-ae228857c2f6)

In your forked collection, select the relevant `baseUrl` variable depending on you subscription (`https://api.deepl.com/v2` for **Pro**, `https://api-free.deepl.com/v2` for **Free**).

In the Authorization section of your forked collection, you will see the value `DeepL-Auth-Key [yourAuthKey]`. Change `[yourAuthKey]` for your own key and you're ready to go!
