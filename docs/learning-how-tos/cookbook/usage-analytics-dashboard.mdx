  Usage Analytics Demo Dashboard on GitHub
</Card>


This open-source demo dashboard shows how to visualize DeepL API key usage across your entire account, powered by a single API call to the `/v2/admin/analytics` endpoint. It provides interactive charts, flexible date ranges, and per-API-key breakdowns to help you monitor and analyze your API usage.

The dashboard is designed to be lightweight and easy to set up, with zero NPM dependencies and sample data included for testing. It can be used as-is, or as an example of how similar data can be incorporated into your own internal workflows and dashboards.

For more information about the DeepL Admin API endpoint, check out the [Admin API documentation](/api-reference/admin-api/organization-usage-analytics).
