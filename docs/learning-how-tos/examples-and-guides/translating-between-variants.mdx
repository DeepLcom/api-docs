The DeepL API can translate between variants of the same language (for example, from pt-PT to pt-BR or from en-US to en-GB) using a few methods:

- **[Write/Rephrase endpoint](/api-reference/improve-text)**: Rephrases text into the target language variant. This method is fully supported.

<Info> 
Please note that currently, the methods outlined below are not fully supported for this use case and may not always perform as intended. We encourage you to conduct your own evaluations.

Both glossaries and style rules are unique to each of DeepL's global data centers and are not shared between them. Clients using the api-us.deepl.com endpoint will not be able to access glossaries or style rules created in the UI at this time. 
</Info>

- **[Style rules](/api-reference/style-rules)**: Create a custom style rule in the UI such as “translate to British English” and apply it using the [style_id](/api-reference/translate/request-translation#body-style-id) parameter.

- **[Custom instructions](/api-reference/translate/request-translation#body-custom-instructions)**: Add instructions like "translate to British English" to your `/translate` request. You can specify up to 10 custom instructions in conjunction, each with a maximum of 300 characters.

## Example: Converting American English to British English using the custom_instructions parameter:

Example request
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key [yourAuthKey]' \
--data '{
  "text": ["I went to the pharmacy to get some acetaminophen."],
  "target_lang": "en-GB",
  "model_type": "quality_optimized",
  "custom_instructions": ["translate to British English", "only replace words that would be different"]
}'
```

Example response
```json 
{
  "translations": [
    {
      "detected_source_language": "EN",
      "text": "I went to the chemist to get some paracetamol.",
      "model_type_used": "quality_optimized"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>The custom instructions convert American English terms ("pharmacy", "acetaminophen") to British English equivalents ("chemist", "paracetamol") while preserving sentence structure.</Tip>
