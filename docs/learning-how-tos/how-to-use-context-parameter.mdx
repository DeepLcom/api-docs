## What the context parameter is for

The `context` parameter helps DeepL's API translate ambiguous words and short text snippets more accurately by providing the surrounding content. Think of it like showing a human translator the paragraphs before and after the sentence being translated.

The `context` parameter can help with:

- Picking the correct translation for ambiguous words
- Providing grammatical clues for gender, number, or case that isn't clear from the text alone
- Improving translations of short snippets such as headlines or product names

## What the context parameter is NOT for

<Warning>
**Common Misconception:** Many users try to use `context` like ChatGPT system prompts. **This does not work reliably.**

Example of what NOT to do:
```json
{
  "text": ["Welcome back"],
  "target_lang": "DE",
  "context": "Translate with a friendly, casual tone" // ❌ Won't work as expected
}
```
</Warning>

The `context` parameter is **not** designed for:

- LLM-style instructions: "Translate with a friendly, casual tone"
- Translation rules: "Always translate 'Tor' as 'gate'"
- Cultural context: "Adapt for German cultural norms"

Using `context` like this will produce unpredictable results. The parameter is optimized for document content, not commands.

Instead, try:
- [Style rules and custom instructions](/api-reference/style-rules): For tone, style, formatting, and translation instructions
- [Glossaries](/api-reference/multilingual-glossaries): For consistent terminology and brand names

## How to use context for ambiguous words

When a word has multiple meanings, surrounding context helps the translation engine choose the correct interpretation.

### Example

"Tor" could mean "gate" or "goal" in German. Without context, DeepL may not know which meaning you intend:

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate' \
--header 'Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key [your key]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "text": [
    "Die Person stand vor dem Tor."
  ],
  "target_lang": "EN-US"
}'
```

**Output without context:**
```text
"The person was standing in front of the gate."
```

If you're writing about a football game, provide context to clarify:

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate' \
--header 'Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key [your key]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "text": [
    "Die Person stand vor dem Tor."
  ],
  "target_lang": "EN-US",
  "context": "Es war ein Fußballspiel."
}'
```

**Output with context:**
```text
"The person was standing in front of the goal."
```

### When to use this approach

- You're translating short snippets that lack built-in context
- The text contains words with multiple meanings
- The surrounding content makes the intended meaning clear

## How to use context for grammatical gender

When grammatical gender isn't clear from the source text, context can provide the necessary clues.

### Example

Without context, DeepL may not use the desired gender when translating:

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate' \
--header 'Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key [your key]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "text": [
    "The teacher asked the class to tidy up after they finished the lesson."
  ],
  "target_lang": "DE"
}'
```

**Output without context:** (uses masculine form "Lehrer")
```text
"Der Lehrer bat die Klasse, nach der Stunde aufzuräumen."
```

You can provide context from the surrounding text that clarifies the teacher's gender:

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate' \
--header 'Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key [your key]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "text": [
    "The teacher asked the class to tidy up after they finished the lesson."
  ],
  "target_lang": "DE",
  "context": "She did not want to tidy up herself."
}'
```

**Output with context:** (uses feminine form "Lehrerin")
```text
"Die Lehrerin bat die Klasse, nach der Stunde aufzuräumen."
```

### When to use this approach

- Translating into languages with grammatical gender
- The source text doesn't specify gender
- You have surrounding sentences that contain gender clues

## How to use context for consistent name translation

When translating names in headlines or short snippets, the same name might be transliterated differently unless additional context is provided.

### Example

Content is not shared between `text` parameters. This results in different transliterations for the name "Sergej".

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate' \
--header 'Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key [your key]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "text": [
    "Sergej gibt Stellungnahme ab",
    "Sergej Zhivkov erklärte gestern, dass neue Maßnahmen ergriffen werden."
  ],
  "source_lang": "DE",
  "target_lang": "EN-US"
}'
```

**Output without context:**
```json
{
  "translations": [
    {
      "detected_source_language": "DE",
      "text": "Sergej makes a statement"
    },
    {
      "detected_source_language": "DE",
      "text": "Sergei Zhivkov explained yesterday that new measures will be taken."
    }
  ]
}
```

Providing a longer snippet of `context` containing the complete name results in consistent transliteration:

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate' \
--header 'Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key [your key]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "text": [
    "Sergej gibt Stellungnahme ab",
    "Sergej Zhivkov erklärte gestern, dass neue Maßnahmen ergriffen werden."
  ],
  "source_lang": "DE",
  "target_lang": "EN-US",
  "context": "Sergej Zhivkov erklärte gestern, dass neue Maßnahmen ergriffen werden."
}'
```

**Output with context:**
```json
{
    "translations": [
        {
            "detected_source_language": "DE",
            "text": "Sergei issues statement"
        },
        {
            "detected_source_language": "DE",
            "text": "Sergei Zhivkov declared yesterday that new measures will be taken."
        }
    ]
}
```

### When to use this approach

- Translating news headlines separately from article bodies
- Transliterating names with multiple possible spellings in your target language

## Technical details

### Cost

Characters in the `context` parameter do not count toward billing. Only characters sent in the `text` parameter are billed.

### Size limit

There is no size limit for the `context` parameter itself, but the request body size limit of 128 KiB applies to all text translation requests.

### Multi-`text` requests

Content is not shared between multiple `text` parameters sent in one request. Each text parameter is translated independently.

In this example, "Tor" might be translated as "gate" instead of "goal" because the first `text` doesn't have access to the second one's content.

```python
{
  "text": [
    "Die Person stand vor dem Tor.",
    "Es war ein Fußballspiel."
  ],
  "target_lang": "EN-US"
}
```

To ensure "Tor" is translated as "goal", you can add additional sentences into the `context` parameter, or keep related content together in one `text` parameter.

If you send a request with both `context` and multiple `text` parameters, the `context` parameter will be applied to each one.

### Document translation

When using the [document translation endpoint](/api-reference/document), the engine automatically uses the broader document context. You don't need to provide explicit context for full documents.

### Tag handling

When using `tag_handling=xml` or `tag_handling=html`, tags are *not* used as a context boundary. The translation engine automatically looks across all content provided in each `text` parameter. As with other types of texts, you may need to provide additional `context` when translating single tags without surrounding content.
