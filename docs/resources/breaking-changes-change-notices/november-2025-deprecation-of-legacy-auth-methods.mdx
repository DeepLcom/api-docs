title: "November 2025: Deprecation of query parameter and request body authentication"
---

## Change Notice

<Info>
Update: The deadline for this deprecation has been extended to January 15th, 2026.
</Info>

On November 1st, 2025, DeepL will fully obsolesce support for providing authentication information in an `auth_key` query parameter or in an `auth_key` field of the request body.

Deprecation of this feature was previously announced in [March 2025](/docs/resources/breaking-changes-change-notices/march-2025-deprecating-get-requests-to-translate-and-authenticating-with-auth_key), but we have continued to support it temporarily to allow more time for customers to complete the migration.

You will no longer be able to authenticate a request to any endpoint by sending an API key in a query parameter or request body. Instead, send your API key in an HTTP header named `Authorization`.

* **You will no longer be able to authenticate a request to any endpoint by sending an API key in a query parameter or in the request body.** Instead, send your API key in an HTTP header named `Authorization` .
* **If you use one of DeepL's officially-supported client libraries, you won't be negatively affected by the breaking changes and do not need to update your application.** Specifically, we've confirmed the following client library versions:
  * [deepl-php](https://github.com/deeplcom/deepl-php): 1.0.0+
  * [deepl-python](https://github.com/deeplcom/deepl-python): 1.0.0+
  * [deepl-java](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-java): 1.0.0+
  * [deepl-dotnet](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-dotnet): 1.0.0+
  * [deepl-node](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-node): 1.1.0+
  * [deepl-rb](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-rb): 3.0.0+

Going forward, you will need to authorize any API request, to any endpoint, by including your 
API key in an HTTP header named `Authorization`, like this:

```
Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key [yourAuthKey]
```

For detailed information on authorization and how to use the Authorization header, please see the [documentation](https://developers.deepl.com/docs/getting-started/auth). 
Going forward, you will not be able to authorize any request, to any endpoint, by including your API key in an `auth_key` query parameter or an `auth_key` field of the request body.

### Why is DeepL doing this now?
The API best practice is to authenticate a request by including the API key in an HTTP header. Sending an API key in a GET request or in a URL risks exposing the API key to the public via logs or other means. For privacy and security reasons, we must disallow this practice.

### What if I continue to use non-header authentication?
After the date above, translation requests that attempt to authenticate with an `auth_key` query parameter or an `auth_key` field in the request body will fail with a `403 Forbidden` response.

### What action should I take so that I’m not affected?
If you develop your own application using the DeepL API:

- Ensure your code is not using either of the deprecated features.

If you’re using a third-party plugin that is powered by the DeepL API:

- Update to the most recent version of the plugin. If you experience trouble, contact the plugin provider to make sure they are aware of these deprecations.
