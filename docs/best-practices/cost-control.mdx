As a DeepL API Pro user, you have the option to set a limit on the number of characters that can be translated in your entire subscription per month, thereby limiting your maximum costs. You only need to activate *Cost Control* in your DeepL Pro Account on the "API Keys & Limits" tab.

To do so:

1. Navigate to the ["API Keys & Limits" tab](https://www.deepl.com/your-account/keys)

2. Click *Manage cost control*

3. Tick the checkbox *Activate cost control* to enable

4. Enter the maximum cost amount

5. Click "Submit" to save the changes

Your new cost control limit is applied immediately.

Once you have reached your limit, DeepL will not process any further translation requests until the end of the usage period, in order to not exceed your set maximum cost. If you would like to translate more, you can make changes to the cost control limit at any time.

#### *I have been notified that my Cost Control was raised, but I didn't raise it. What should I do?*

Every time your *Cost Control* limit is raised, you will receive a notification email for security reasons. If you receive such a notification, but you did not raise your *Cost Control* limit, we highly suggest you reset your authentication key and the password to your DeepL Pro account as soon as possible.
