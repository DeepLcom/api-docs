<Info>
This page documents `v3` glossary endpoints, which let you edit glossaries and makes them multilingual.

[See here](/api-reference/glossaries) for information on `v2` glossaries. [See here](/api-reference/glossaries/v2-vs-v3-endpoints) for an overview of the difference.
</Info>

## Overview

The `glossaries` endpoints let you work with [DeepL glossaries](https://support.deepl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021634540-About-the-glossary), which let you specify specific translations for words or short phrases. Each glossary contains a mapping of source phrases to target phrases. During translation, DeepL intelligently flexes entries to account for case, gender, tense, and other grammar features (if the target language has flexion).

Currently you can create glossaries with [any of the languages DeepL supports](../docs/getting-started/supported-languages).  Any updates will be noted here, as well as in [the /languages endpoint and documentation](../docs/getting-started/supported-languages).

A **glossary** contains (several) **dictionaries**. A **dictionary** is a mapping of source phrases to target phrases for a single language pair, like this:

<table><thead><tr><th>French -></th><th>Spanish</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>belle</td><td>hermosa</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>delicieux</td><td>exquisito</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>mouse</td><td>mouse</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Note that this mapping occurs only in one direction, which is all you need during a single translation. If you wanted your glossary to contain the reverse mapping, so that you could apply the same glossary when translating from French to Spanish and from Spanish to French, you would add a second dictionary:

<table><thead><tr><th>Spanish -></th><th>French</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>hermosa</td><td>belle</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>exquisito</td><td>delicieux</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>mouse</td><td>mouse</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Creating glossaries

### Formats

You can format glossary entries as either CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values). In each case, each entry is a line containing a source phrase and its associated target phrase.

CSV entries for our Spanish → French glossary above would look like this:
```
hermosa,belle
exquisito,delicieux
mouse,mouse
```

You can also enclose each phrase in quotation marks:

```
"hermosa","belle"
"exquisito","delicieux"
"mouse","mouse"
```

TSV is similar, except that the source and target phrases are separated by a tab, not a comma.

CSV entries in DeepL glossaries follow standard CSV conventions, such as

* fields containing double quotes or commas must be enclosed in double quotes,
* if double quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double quote appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with another double quote.

<Info>
In CSV, you can also include the source and target language after the source and target phrases. If those do not match the language pair for the current dictionary, the entry will be ignored.
</Info>

### Create a glossary

`POST /v3/glossaries`

To create a glossary, send the API an array that contains one or more dictionaries. (As described above, a dictionary is a collection of mappings from source phrases in one language to target phrases in another.)

This example creates a modest glossary with two dictionaries. One maps "Hello" in English to "Guten Tag" in German. The other contains the reverse mapping.

## Editing

### Add a new dictionary, or replace an existing one

`PUT /v3/glossaries/{glossaryId}/dictionaries`

The `PUT` method acts on a single dictionary of a glossary. It creates a new dictionary in that glossary, or replaces an existing one, without regard to whether that dictionary already exists. If the glossary has no dictionary for a given language pair, add the dictionary to the glossary with the entries provided. If the dictionary already exists, replace it.

Use this method to add a new dictionary to a glossary or replace an existing one. To instead merge a set of entries with an existing dictionary, use [the `PATCH` method](/api-reference/multilingual-glossaries#add-new-entries-to-a-dictionary%2C-or-replace-existing-entries).

### Add new entries to a dictionary, or replace existing entries

`PATCH /v3/glossaries/{glossaryId}`

While the `PUT` method operates on a single dictionary, `PATCH` affects an element of an entire glossary. This element could be a piece of metadata - like the glossary's name - or a dictionary for a particular language pair.

This method returns the glossary's name and metadata on each of its dictionaries.

For example, this `PATCH` changes a glossary's name.

You can also use `PATCH` to change the contents of a glossary's dictionary  for a language pair while taking any existing dictionary for that language pair into account. If the glossary already has a dictionary for the specified language pair, the entries passed here will be merged with the existing dictionary.&#x20;

Use this method to make changes to an existing dictionary. To replace a dictionary outright, use [the PUT method](./#add-a-new-dictionary-or-replace-an-existing-one).

This example makes two changes. It changes the glossary's name, and it adds a new entry to its German → English dictionary.

## Notes on usage

### Language variants

Glossaries apply to languages, not specific language variants. A glossary for a language applies to any variant of that language.

For example, if you create a glossary with target language `EN` , that glossary will apply to `EN-US` and `EN-GB`. A glossary with target language `PR` will apply to `PT-PT` and `PT-BR`.

### Source language detection

Glossaries can not (yet) be used in translation requests that do not set a specific source language. [Your feedback here](/docs/resources/deepl-developer-community) is valuable as we strive to improve our API.

## Restrictions

### Size

A dictionary can contain a maximum of 10 MB. This is true for each dictionary in a glossary. So, if a glossary contains five dictionaries, each if its dictionaries could contain up to 10 MB, for a total of 50 MB.

The name of the glossary, each source phrase, and each target phrase, can contain up to 1024 UTF-8 bytes.

The number of glossaries you can make is [limited by your plan](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api).

### Sharing

Presently, you cannot share glossaries between the DeepL API and DeepL's web or phone apps. Work is underway to end this restriction.

### Content
* Duplicate source entries are not allowed.
* Neither the source nor the target entry may be empty.
* The source and target entries must not contain any C0 or C1 control characters (including, e.g., `\t` or `\n`) or any Unicode newline.
