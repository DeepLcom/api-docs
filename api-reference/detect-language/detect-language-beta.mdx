title: "Detect Language API (Beta)"
description: "(Hidden Page) Detect the language of text using DeepL's language detection service"
---

<Note>
  **Work in Progress** - This documentation page is still being developed and is not ready for public consumption.
</Note>

The Detect Language API allows you to identify the language of text content. This is a beta feature that requires special access permissions and is currently available only to select accounts.

## Best Practices

1. **Text Length**: Provide sufficient text for accurate detection. Very short texts may result in `"insufficient_confidence"` or `"internal_error"`.

2. **Batch Processing**: You can detect multiple texts in a single request by providing an array of strings.

3. **Error Handling**: Check the `detection_successful` field before using the `predicted_language` value.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits when making frequent requests.

## Feature Availability

This is a **beta feature** that requires:
- Account enrollment in the language detection beta program
- Compatible API key with appropriate permissions

Reach out to your DeepL contact to request access to the language detection API beta.

## Endpoint

```
POST /v3/detect/language
```

## Authentication

This endpoint requires authentication using the `DeepL-Auth-Key` header with a valid API key that has access to the language detection feature.

### Request Parameters

<ParamField body="text" type="string[]" required>
  List of text strings to detect languages for. Each string will be processed separately.
</ParamField>

  <Tab title="200 Success">
    ```json
    {
      "results": [
        {
          "predicted_language": "en",

        },
        {
          "predicted_language": "es", 
          "detection_successful": true

    This error occurs when:
    - The inputs in the request are malformed
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="403 Forbidden">
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Forbidden"
    }
    ```

    This error occurs when:
    - The API key doesn't have access to the language detection feature
    - The account doesn't have the required permissions
    - The feature flag is not enabled for the account
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="415 Unsupported Media Type">
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Called with an unsupported media type. Supported media types: application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Please set the Content-Type header to a supported type."
    }
    ```

    This error occurs when:
    - The request is in an unsupported format
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="500 Internal Server Error">
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Internal server error."
    }
    ```

    This error occurs when there are issues with the internal language detection service.

### Response Fields

<ResponseField name="results" type="array" required>
  Array of detection results, one for each input text. Each result object contains a `predicted_language` and a `detection_successful` field.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="predicted_language" type="string" required>
  The detected language code or special status value. Can be either:
  
  **Language Codes** (when `detection_successful` is `true`):
  - Standard BCP-47 language codes:  one of `"en"`, `"de"`, `"fr"`, `"es"`, `"pt"`, `"it"`, `"nl"`, `"pl"`, `"ru"`, `"zh"`, `"ja"`, `"bg"`, `"cs"`, `"da"`, `"el"`, `"et"`, `"fi"`, `"hu"`, `"lt"`, `"lv"`, `"ro"`, `"sk"`, `"sl"`, `"sv"`, `"tr"`, `"id"`, `"uk"`, `"ko"`, `"nb"`, `"ar"`, `"vi"`, `"he"`, `"th"`
  - See [supported languages](/docs/getting-started/supported-languages#translation-source-languages) for more info
  
  **Special Status Values** (when `detection_successful` is `false`):
  - `"insufficient_confidence"` - Detection confidence too low
  - `"unsupported"` - Language not supported by DeepL
  - `"no_detections"` - No result returned, try longer text
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="detection_successful" type="boolean" required>
  Indicates whether language detection was successful:
  - `true` - Language successfully detected
  - `false` - Detection failed (see special status values above)
</ResponseField>

## Limitations

- Only supports detection of languages that are available in DeepL's translation service
- Requires high confidence to return the language
- Only returns the first top language guess for any single text
- Limited to text-based detection (no support for document formats)
