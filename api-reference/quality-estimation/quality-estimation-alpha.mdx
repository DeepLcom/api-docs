title: "Quality Estimation API (Alpha ⚠️)"
description: "(Hidden Page) Evaluate translation quality using DeepL's bilingual quality estimation service"
---

<Danger>
    **Work in Progress** - This documentation page is hidden from the public and should not be shared with non-approved stakeholders. Updates to this endpoint may be more frequent than normal because this endpoint is expected to have a higher rate of change during alpha development.
</Danger>

The Quality Estimation API allows you to evaluate the quality of translations by comparing source and target text pairs. This unstable alpha feature requires special access permissions and is currently available only to select customers.

## Alpha Reliability Notice

<Note>
    **Alpha Endpoint Standards** - This is an unstable alpha endpoint with lower reliability and higher error rate thresholds compared to production APIs. While we strive for stability, you may experience occasional errors or service interruptions.

    **Please report issues**: If you notice consistently high error rates or reliability problems, please contact your DeepL representative so we can investigate and address them.
</Note>

## Customer Access

Access to this alpha endpoint is granted on a per-customer basis. Due to the alpha nature of this feature:
- Each customer must individually request access to the quality estimation alpha program
- Access is manually granted by contacting your DeepL representative
- This endpoint is not supported by any DeepL SDKs or client libraries.
- There is no guarantee that breaking changes won't occur.

## Best Practices

1. **Text Quality**: Provide complete, well-formed text in both source and target fields for accurate quality assessment.

2. **Language Codes**: Always specify explicit language codes. Use language variants (e.g., `en-US`, `pt-BR`) when appropriate for more accurate evaluation.

3. **Prompt Selection**: Choose preset categories that match your quality criteria, or use custom prompts for specific evaluation needs. Note that when both `preset_category` and `custom_prompt` are provided in the same prompt object, `preset_category` takes precedence.

4. **Error Handling**: Always check the HTTP status code and handle errors appropriately. Alpha endpoints may experience higher error rates.

5. **Batch Requests**: The API supports multiple prompts in a single request. Results are returned in the same order as the prompts array.

### Request Parameters

<ParamField body="source_text" type="string" required>
    The source text to evaluate. This is the original text before translation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source_lang" type="string" required>
    Language code of the source text. Must be a valid source language code (case-insensitive).

    See [Valid Language Codes](#valid-language-codes) for the complete list of supported languages.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="target_text" type="string" required>
    The translated target text to evaluate. This is the translation that will be assessed for quality.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="target_lang" type="string" required>
    Language code of the target text. Must be a valid target language code (case-insensitive).

    Target languages include language variants (e.g., `en-US`, `en-GB`, `pt-BR`, `pt-PT`).

    See [Valid Language Codes](#valid-language-codes) for the complete list.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="prompts" type="array" required>
    List of quality estimation prompts to evaluate. Each prompt object must contain **one** of:
    - `preset_category` (string): A predefined quality category
    - `custom_prompt` (string): A custom evaluation prompt

    **Important**: Do not provide both fields to `preset_category`, only one of `preset_category` or `custom_prompt`

    **Note**: The response will contain results in the same order as the prompts array.
</ParamField>

### Prompts Array Structure

Each item in the `prompts` array is an object with one of these fields:

**Using Preset Categories:**

Example:
```json
{
  "preset_category": "adequacy"
}
```

**Using Custom Prompts:**
```json
{
  "custom_prompt": "Evaluate whether the translation maintains the technical accuracy of the original text"
}
```

**Multiple Prompts:**
```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {"preset_category": "adequacy"},
    {"preset_category": "fluency"}
  ]
}
```

## Valid Values

### Preset Categories

The following 16 preset categories are available for quality estimation:

#### **`adequacy`**
Does the translation accurately preserve the meaning and information given in the original text?

#### **`clarity`**
Is the text clear and easy to understand or is it confusing, convoluted and difficult to follow?

**Unclear example:** "The implementation thereof considering various factors which may or may not impact the eventual outcome of said process."

#### **`coherence`**
Are the ideas in the text coherent and well connected or do they appear random and unrelated to each other?

**Incoherent example:** "Dogs need exercise. The sky is blue. Some people like pizza. Exercise is important for health."

**Coherent example:** "Dogs need daily exercise to maintain good health. Regular walks not only provide physical activity but also help establish consistent routines, which veterinarians highly recommend."

#### **`complexity_of_words`**
Does the text use very common and simple words or does it contain rare, advanced or specialized vocabulary?

**Low complexity example:** "The dog runs fast."

**High complexity example:** "The exuberant canine pursued the sphere with remarkable alacrity."

#### **`creativity`**
Is the content of the text creative and original or is it cliché and predictable?

**Non-creative example:** "Time heals all wounds."

**Creative example:** "Time doesn't heal our wounds - it teaches them to dance with us, transforming scars into stories."

#### **`emotional_impact`**
Does the text cause a strong emotional connection or is there no impact at all?

**No emotional impact example:** "The event occurred on Tuesday."

**Strong emotional impact example:** "Tears of joy flowed freely as grandparents embraced grandchildren they'd only known through video calls, their trembling hands touching real faces for the first time in years."

#### **`engagement`**
Is the text dry and technical or is it highly engaging using vivid language and compelling presentation?

**Low engagement example:** "The data indicates a 23% increase in productivity."

**High engagement example:** "In a remarkable achievement, our team shattered all previous records with a stunning 23% productivity increase, transforming our workplace into a hub of innovation."

#### **`fluency`**
Does the translation seem unnatural and like a machine translation? Is it generally natural but with some awkward phrasing? Or does it appear as if it was originally written in the target language?

**Non-fluent text:** "I my homework did complete yesterday evening time."

**Moderately fluent:** "I completed my homework in the time of yesterday evening."

**Fluent text:** "I finished my homework last night."

#### **`formality`**
Does the text use casual language, slang or conversational tone, or uses precise, professional language and maintains an objective, impersonal tone throughout?

#### **`grammar`**
Does the text contain basic grammatical structure, i.e. using simple sentences with basic subject-verb-object order? Or does it use multiple verb tenses, conditional and subjunctive moods, relative clauses, etc.?

**Simple grammar example:** "The dog runs. The boy plays."

**Complex grammar example:** "Had the dog not been running so quickly, it might have been caught by the boy, who, having finished his meal, decided that playing outside was preferable to staying indoors, despite the weather having turned colder than expected."

#### **`idiomatic_speech`**
Is the text purely literal or does it include metaphors, similes, hyperbole and other figures to enhance the text's imagery?

#### **`jargon`**
Does the text use plain language or is it filled with industry-specific terms and acronyms that would be difficult for a non-expert to understand?

#### **`persuasiveness`**
Does the text make claims without support or does it provide comprehensive and compelling evidence?

**Low persuasiveness example:** "Our product is the best choice."

**High persuasiveness example:** "Our product stands out as the optimal choice, backed by a 95% customer satisfaction rate, independent laboratory testing, and endorsements from industry experts. Furthermore, our five-year warranty demonstrates our confidence in its durability."

#### **`politeness`**
Is the text using direct, blunt language or does it use courtesy markers, indirect requests and other polite expressions?

#### **`punctuation`**
Does the text use basic punctuation marks like periods, question marks and exclamation points or does it demonstrate skillful use of advanced markers like semicolons, em dashes, parentheses, etc.? (Depending on the language)

#### **`syntax`**
Does the text use simple sentences with a single clause or is it using an intricate sentence structure, local and non-local dependencies or multiple levels of subordination?

**Simple syntax example:** "The dog runs fast. The sun is bright."

**Complex syntax example:** "Despite the misgivings of the harried council members, who questioned both the veracity of her arcane research and the prudence of embarking on such a perilous voyage—an undertaking complicated further by the baffling instructions, scant provisions, and unreliable cartographic clues—she nevertheless resolved, with an unwavering sense of duty, to traverse the uncharted seas in hopes of unearthing the fabled relic that, if the legends and cryptic manuscripts held any grain of truth, promised to restore balance to their beleaguered kingdom."

All preset category names are case-sensitive and must be provided exactly as shown above.

### Valid Language Codes

Language codes are **case-insensitive**.

See [supported languages](/docs/getting-started/supported-languages) for detailed information about each language.
