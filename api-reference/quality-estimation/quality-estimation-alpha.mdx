title: "Quality Estimation API (Unstable Alpha)"
description: "(Hidden Page) Evaluate translation quality using DeepL's bilingual quality estimation service"
---

<Note>
  **Work in Progress** - This documentation page is still being developed and is not ready for public consumption.
</Note>

The Quality Estimation API allows you to evaluate the quality of translations by comparing source and target text pairs. This unstable alpha feature requires special access permissions and is currently available only to select accounts.

## Alpha Reliability Notice

<Note>
  **Alpha Endpoint Standards** - This is an unstable alpha endpoint with lower reliability and higher error rate thresholds compared to production APIs. While we strive for stability, you may experience occasional errors or service interruptions.

  **Please report issues**: If you notice consistently high error rates or reliability problems, please contact your DeepL representative so we can investigate and address them promptly.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Text Quality**: Provide complete, well-formed text in both source and target fields for accurate quality assessment.

2. **Language Codes**: Always specify explicit language codes. Use language variants (e.g., `en-US`, `pt-BR`) when appropriate for more accurate evaluation.

3. **Prompt Selection**: Choose preset categories that match your quality criteria, or use custom prompts for specific evaluation needs. Note that when both `preset_category` and `custom_prompt` are provided in the same prompt object, `preset_category` takes precedence.

4. **Error Handling**: Always check the HTTP status code and handle errors appropriately. Alpha endpoints may experience higher error rates.

5. **Batch Requests**: The API supports multiple prompts in a single request. Results are returned in the same order as the prompts array.

## Feature Availability

This is an **unstable alpha feature** that requires:
- Account enrollment in the quality estimation alpha program
- Compatible API key with appropriate permissions (deployed tier access)
- Feature flag: `QualityEstimationAuthorization` enabled for your account

Reach out to your DeepL contact to request access to the quality estimation API alpha.

## Endpoint

### Request Parameters

<ParamField body="source_text" type="string" required>
  The source text to evaluate. This is the original text before translation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source_lang" type="string" required>
  Language code of the source text. Must be a valid source language code (case-insensitive).

  See [Valid Language Codes](#valid-language-codes) for the complete list of supported languages.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="target_text" type="string" required>
  The translated target text to evaluate. This is the translation that will be assessed for quality.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="target_lang" type="string" required>
  Language code of the target text. Must be a valid target language code (case-insensitive).

  Target languages include language variants (e.g., `en-US`, `en-GB`, `pt-BR`, `pt-PT`).

  See [Valid Language Codes](#valid-language-codes) for the complete list.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="prompts" type="array" required>
  List of quality estimation prompts to evaluate. Each prompt object must contain **one** of:
  - `preset_category` (string): A predefined quality category
  - `custom_prompt` (string): A custom evaluation prompt

  **Important**: When both fields are provided in the same prompt object, `preset_category` takes precedence due to protobuf oneof behavior.

  The response will contain results in the same order as the prompts array.
</ParamField>

### Prompts Array Structure

Each item in the `prompts` array is an object with one of these fields:

**Using Preset Categories:**
```json
{
  "preset_category": "adequacy"
}
```

**Using Custom Prompts:**
```json
{
  "custom_prompt": "Evaluate whether the translation maintains the technical accuracy of the original text"
}
```

**Multiple Prompts:**
```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {"preset_category": "adequacy"},
    {"preset_category": "fluency"},
    {"custom_prompt": "Does the translation sound natural to a native speaker?"}
  ]
}
```

## Valid Values

### Preset Categories

The following 16 preset categories are available for quality estimation:

1. **`adequacy`** - Evaluates whether the translation is complete and preserves the meaning of the source text
2. **`idiomatic_speech`** - Checks if the translation uses natural, idiomatic language
3. **`clarity`** - Assesses whether the translated message is clear and easy to understand
4. **`coherence`** - Evaluates the logical flow and consistency of the translation
5. **`engagement`** - Measures how engaging and compelling the translation is for readers
6. **`persuasiveness`** - Evaluates how convincing and persuasive the translation is
7. **`creativity`** - Assesses the creative expression and originality in the translation
8. **`emotional_impact`** - Measures the emotional resonance and impact of the translation
9. **`jargon`** - Evaluates the appropriate use of technical terminology and jargon
10. **`complexity_of_words`** - Assesses the complexity and sophistication of word choice
11. **`grammar`** - Checks grammatical correctness of the translation
12. **`syntax`** - Evaluates the sentence structure and word order
13. **`punctuation`** - Checks proper punctuation usage
14. **`fluency`** - Assesses the overall fluency and readability
15. **`politeness`** - Evaluates the tone and level of politeness
16. **`formality`** - Measures the formality level of the translation

All preset category names are case-sensitive and must be provided exactly as shown above.

## Limitations

- This is an **unstable alpha endpoint** with lower reliability guarantees than production APIs
- Only supports languages available in DeepL's translation service
- Requires both source and target text to be provided (bilingual evaluation only)
- The API evaluates translation quality but does not provide corrections or alternatives
- Custom prompts have length limitations (specific limits may vary)
- Rate limiting applies to prevent abuse
- Feature availability is restricted to accounts enrolled in the alpha program
