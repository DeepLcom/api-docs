  description: |-
    The text-translation API currently consists of a single endpoint, `translate`, which is described below.
- name: TranslateDocuments
  description: |-
    The document translation API allows you to translate whole documents and supports the following file types and extensions:
      * `docx` - Microsoft Word Document
      * `pptx` - Microsoft PowerPoint Document
      * `xlsx` - Microsoft Excel Document
      * `pdf` - Portable Document Format
      * `htm / html` - HTML Document
      * `txt` - Plain Text Document
      * `xlf / xliff` - XLIFF Document, version 2.1
      * `srt` - SRT Document
- name: RephraseText
  description: |-
    The `rephrase` endpoint  is used to make corrections and adjustments to texts based on style or tone.
- name: ManageMultilingualGlossaries
  description: |-
    The *glossary* functions allow you to create, inspect, edit and delete glossaries.
    Glossaries created with the glossary function can be used in translate requests by specifying the
    `glossary_id` parameter. A glossary contains (several) dictionaries.
    A dictionary is a mapping of source phrases to target phrases for a single language pair.
    If you encounter issues, please let us know at support@DeepL.com.

    Currently you can create glossaries with any of the languages DeepL supports.

    The maximum size limit for a glossary is 10 MiB = 10485760 bytes and each source/target text,
    as well as the name of the glossary, is limited to 1024 UTF-8 bytes.
    A total of 1000 glossaries are allowed per account.

    When creating a dictionary with target language `EN`, `PT`, or `ZH`, it's not necessary to specify a variant
    (e.g. `EN-US`, `EN-GB`, `PT-PT`, `PT-BR`, or `ZH-HANS`).
    Dictionaries with target language `EN` can be used in translations with either English variant.
    Similarly `PT`, and `ZH` dictionaries can be used in translations with their corresponding variants.
    (When you provide the ID of a glossary to a translation, the appropriate dictionary is automatically applied. Currently glossaries can not yet be used with source language detection.)

    Glossaries created via the DeepL API are now unified with glossaries created via the DeepL website and DeepL apps.
    Please only use the v3 glossary API in conjunction with multilingual or edited glossaries from the website.
- name: ManageGlossaries
  description: |-
    Please note that this is the spec for the (old) v2 glossary endpoint.
    We recommend users switch to the newer v3 glossary endpoints, which support editability and multilinguality.

    The *glossary* functions allow you to create, inspect, and delete glossaries.
    Glossaries created with the glossary function can be used in translate requests by specifying the
    `glossary_id` parameter.
    If you encounter issues, please let us know at support@DeepL.com.

    Currently you can create glossaries with any of the languages DeepL supports.

        List of XML tags which never split sentences.


        For some XML files, finding tags with textual content and splitting sentences using those tags won't yield the best results. The following example shows the engine splitting sentences on `par` tags and proceeding to translate the parts separately, resulting in an incorrect translation:
         * Example request:
        ```
        <par>The firm said it had been </par><par> conducting an internal investigation.</par>
        ```
         * Example response:
        ```
        <par>Die Firma sagte, es sei eine gute Idee gewesen.</par><par> Durchführung einer internen Untersuchung.</par>
        ```


        As this can lead to bad translations, this type of structure should either be avoided, or the `non_splitting_tags` parameter should be set. The following example shows the same call, with the parameter set to `par`:
         * Example request:
        ```
        <par>The firm said it had been </par><par> conducting an internal investigation.</par>
        ```
         * Example response:
        ```
        <par>Die Firma sagte, dass sie</par><par> eine interne Untersuchung durchgeführt</par><par> habe</par><par>.</par>
        ```


        This time, the sentence is translated as a whole. The XML tags are now considered markup and copied into the translated sentence. As the translation of the words "had been" has moved to another position in the German sentence, the two par tags are duplicated (which is expected here).
