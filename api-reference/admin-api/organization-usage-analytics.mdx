The Admin API allows admins to retrieve detailed usage statistics for their organization through the [Get usage analytics](/api-reference/admin-api/get-usage-analytics) endpoint.

This analytics functionality enables you to:
* Track character usage across your entire organization
* Monitor usage by individual API keys
* Analyze usage patterns over time
* Generate reports for specific date ranges
* Break down usage by service type (text translation, document translation, text improvement)

## Usage statistics endpoint

The analytics endpoint provides detailed usage information for a specified date range with flexible grouping options.

### Date range queries

Retrieve usage statistics by specifying a start and end date. Both `start_date` and `end_date` parameters are required and support the following formats (all in UTC):
* `YYYY-MM-DD` - Simple date format (e.g., `2025-09-29`)
* `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` - Full datetime format (e.g., `2025-09-29T14:30:00`)

The maximum date range is 366 days.

### Grouping options

The optional `group_by` parameter allows you to organize usage data in different ways:

* **No grouping** (default): Returns total usage for the entire date range across all API keys
* **`key`**: Groups usage by individual API key, showing totals for each key over the entire date range
* **`key_and_day`**: Groups usage by both API key and day, providing daily breakdowns for each key

### Usage breakdown

All responses include a breakdown of character usage by service type:
* **Total characters**: Combined usage across all services
* **Text translation characters**: Characters used for text translation
* **Document translation characters**: Characters used for document translation
* **Text improvement characters**: Characters used for text improvement (rephrasing)

## Use cases

The account-level analytics endpoint is particularly useful for:

* **Cost monitoring**: Track usage to stay within budget limits and forecast costs
* **Resource allocation**: Identify which teams or projects (represented by API keys) are using the most resources
* **Usage trends**: Analyze daily or weekly usage patterns to optimize resource planning
* **Compliance and auditing**: Generate detailed usage reports for compliance requirements
* **Performance tracking**: Monitor adoption and usage of different DeepL services within your organization
