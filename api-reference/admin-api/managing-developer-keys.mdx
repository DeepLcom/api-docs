The admin keys allow admins to manage developer keys through DeepL public API. These functionalities are equivalent to
those available in the self-admin area under the ["API Keys & Limits" tab](https://www.deepl.com/your-account/keys):
* Create a developer key
* Get developer keys
* Disable a developer key
* Rename a developer key
* Set developer key limits
