The admin keys allow admins to manage developer keys through DeepL public API. These functionalities are equivalent to
those available in the self-admin area under the ["API Keys & Limits" tab](https://www.deepl.com/your-account/keys).

Learn more on how to use the admin API endpoints in [API Reference: Admin API](/api-reference/admin-api).
