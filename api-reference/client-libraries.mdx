Client library features include but are not limited to:

* Out-of-the-box retries with exponential backoff for correct handling of 429 and 500 errors
* Persistent HTTP connection (keep-alive) enabled by default
* All document translation steps (upload, check status, and download) consolidated into a single convenience function

All officially supported client libraries, which you can find in the [DeepL Github Organization](https://github.com/DeepLcom/), are open source under the MIT License.

Please note that the Ruby client library is still under development and is not yet fully supported by DeepL. We will update this page when development work is complete!

We welcome feedback in the form of issues and pull requests!
