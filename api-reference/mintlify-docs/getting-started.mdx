# Getting Started with DeepL Style Rules

This guide will help you understand how to use DeepL Style Rules to improve your translations.

## What Are Style Rules?

Style rules are configuration options that control how DeepL formats your translations. They help ensure consistency and meet specific requirements for different types of content.

## Understanding Rule Structure

Each rule has:

- **Category** - The type of formatting (dates, numbers, style, etc.)
- **Parameter** - The specific aspect being controlled
- **Options** - The available choices for that parameter

## Choosing the Right Rules

### For Business Content
- Use **Style and Tone** rules for appropriate formality
- Apply **Numbers and Currency** rules for financial data
- Consider **Text Formatting** rules for contact information

### For Technical Documentation
- Use **Punctuation** rules for consistent formatting
- Apply **Vocabulary** rules for technical terms
- Consider **Spelling and Grammar** rules for consistency

### For Academic Writing
- Use **Dates and Times** rules for proper citation formats
- Apply **Style and Tone** rules for appropriate formality
- Consider **Punctuation** rules for proper academic formatting

## Language-Specific Considerations

Different languages have different available rules based on their linguistic characteristics:

- **English variants** - Choose between US, UK, Canadian, etc.
- **Romance languages** - Consider formality levels and regional variants
- **Asian languages** - Handle character sets and honorifics appropriately

## Testing Your Rules

1. **Start with sample content** - Test with typical content from your domain
2. **Try different combinations** - See how rules work together
3. **Check multiple languages** - Ensure rules work for all target languages
4. **Validate output** - Review translations for consistency and accuracy

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-configuration** - Don't set rules you don't need
- **Conflicting rules** - Some rules may not work well together
- **Language limitations** - Not all rules are available in all languages
- **Inconsistent application** - Apply rules consistently across content
