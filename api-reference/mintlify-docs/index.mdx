# DeepL Style Rules

DeepL Style Rules allow you to customize how your translations are formatted and styled. This documentation covers all available rules across all supported languages, helping you create consistent, professional translations.

## What Are Style Rules?

Style rules are configuration options that control specific aspects of your translations:

- **Dates and Times** - How dates, times, and temporal expressions are formatted
- **Text Formatting** - URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, and structured text
- **Numbers and Currency** - How numbers, currency, and measurements are displayed
- **Punctuation** - Punctuation marks, quotation marks, and typography
- **Spelling and Grammar** - Language-specific conventions and preferences
- **Style and Tone** - Formality, voice, and stylistic choices
- **Vocabulary** - Technical terms and specialized vocabulary
